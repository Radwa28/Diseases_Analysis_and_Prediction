Healthcare ML Projects

Description:
Machine Learning projects focused on healthcare datasets, where I applied advanced techniques to improve model performance and reliability. These projects addressed common ML challenges, including overfitting, imbalanced data, and accuracy optimization.

Key Features:

Implemented supervised learning algorithms for prediction tasks

Used oversampling techniques (SMOTE, RandomOverSampler) to handle class imbalance

Applied regularization and cross-validation to reduce overfitting

Tuned hyperparameters and feature selection to improve prediction accuracy

Developed Python-based ML pipelines for preprocessing, training, and evaluation

Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Outcome: Built robust and accurate ML models that overcame data challenges and delivered actionable healthcare insights.
